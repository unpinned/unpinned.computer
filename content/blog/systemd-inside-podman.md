==UPDATE: Apparently you don't have to change bools anymore! Its supported out of the box now! https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/397#issuecomment-1343214681==

~~For Linux distributions that use SELinux (eg. Fedora Linux) the first thing you have to do is to let SELinux know that you are allowing to run systemd inside a Podman container.~~

~~You have to change the `container_manage_cgroup` bool.~~

~~To do this run `setsebool -P -N container_manage_cgroup 1`~~

Then you have to build your Containerfile which installs and initalizes systemd.

Most minimal example:

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:37

RUN dnf -y install systemd; dnf clean all

CMD [ "/sbin/init" ]
```

To build the image run `podman build -t systemd .`

And you can start your container now.

`podman run --name my-systemd-container -d systemd:latest`

To enter the container run `podman exec -ti my-systemd-container /bin/bash`
